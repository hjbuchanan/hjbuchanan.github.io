The last third of Fullstack is underway. The beginning of this week saw our capstone projects launch, a new project management system(read: public shame if your sticky notes don't move up the window and they all stay in back log. Nothing like some accoutanbility systems). But really, these two day sprints are sprints, and they keep me on track. I respond well to structure it seems. And peer pressure.


It's been fun having the freedom to work on our own projects, struggle a little bit through our own problems, and also help guide each other through issues that come up. Especially since we aren't all struggling through the same bug. We get to ask questions, suggest features, and be eachother's cheerleaders. I know it's cheesey, but I like that stuff. I love watching my friends here put out amazing code and applitions. See [foodoo](http://foodoo.io) to see what I mean. It's only going to get better, and promise me, you want to be an early user. All in all, the capstones have been really fun so far. It really gives me a taste of what it's going to be like building out in the real world. And it feels good!


Nimit and David gave us a Monay morning pep talk. It was inspiring. If Fullstack doesn't work out, they may just have a spot on the motivational speaking circuit. The phrase that stuck with me is that these last four weeks are a "high impact time". We may have faltered in the beginning, we may have started with a strong stride, but regardless these are the four weeks that can make or break us. We have the opportunity to really dig into some of the subject matter we've already learned, refine and hone our skills, and also explore some new technology to make us even more competitive. We aren't struggling (as much) with the basics and that means that this is only going to get more fun--and complex. With the launch of the capstones I can already feel the creative and coder juices flowing. It's motivating and energizing and makes me grind into the code for hours. What a feeling. And when you fix that bug, get that map to show up, or write a function that passes a test---you can hear those angels singing Hallelujah. Or maybe you do a little fist pump.

OH. And I got a cronut. I felt like I needed to start this week off right. For all of you who are wondering, it was delicious, divine, and devoured. It was also the first snow of the season while I waited in line, so that alone shows you the dedication(who needs toes anyway?). It was worth every shiver and every breath of visible air. And all the smiles on everyone's faces at Fullstack as they took a bite and gave me a thumbs up. I'll probably go back once more for the December flavor.
