## Rails on Rails

This week we started to build our first big Rails project. To be honest, I was completely nervous and freaked out about starting a group project on Rails. I felt like we had barely been exposed to the framework by working in it on StackWorld. But as is usually the case, I think David and Nimit were right to throw us into a big group project this soon. I think I have a natural tendency to want to sort it all out before I actually do anything, and sometimes the most effective way to learn is to just do it--break some things (a lot of things), and then learn how to fix them.

My group was one of the groups with four members. In some ways, I think this gave us an advantage. Four minds working on a problem, three other people to ask questions when something goes wrong. But it also meant we had to be a little more organized and had to make sure that we were keeping track of everyone's work. Our group was really into the SCRUM model and using Trello. Actually, we loved [Trello](https://trello.com/). We loved scrumming. We held scrum meetings two or three times a day (depending on the issues that arise and the work flow). I honestly don't know how other groups kept track of their project without it. Y'all are crazy. Trello really allowed us to see our progress and also helped us define our goals around our project more clearly. There wasn't wasted effort because we knew the tasks that had to be completed. I think I'll continue to use Trello for future group projects and even for projects that I'm working on independently. I love the over view that it gives you, and the ability to see the longer term goals as well as the details. Kudos and thanks to the people of Trello.

Back to Rails. What's neat about Rails is basically everything. There are a ton of built in conventions and helper methods defined for you. It anticipates what you will want and need and it practically hands you a good bit of this on a platter. But things aren't all ruby and roses in Rails. Rails conventions are great. Until you break them. Accidentally. Or you name something with or without the desired 's'. Note to all: grammar IS important. Typos will cause death by error messages. Don't be fooled, that comma matters. You may spend an hour deciphering an error message and trying all different types of syntax for a route and come to find out that you were missing a comma. Not that that's ever happened to me... But really, as you dig in more to the set up it all starts to make more sense. I'm definitely not all there yet, but it's getting more natural. I trust my intuition more, and I'm not as scared to break something. If I do, that's okay. I just won't push it up. Or I'll do a stash. Or I'll git reset --hard. I may have over utilized that tool in the beginning of our project haha. Git is a whole other story. But it is magic as well and I love it.


On a more personal level, this week has definitely been a tipping point. I think learning any new skill is a challenge and can bring about frustrations and doubts. And I think I let that get in my head for awhile. And the crazy thing was that I knew it was happening. I knew that I was letting self doubt and a lack of confidence affect my work and learning curve. I think this week I may have overcome that, or at least started that process. Coding became WAY more fun as I started to trust my instincts more, and started to solve some problems on my own. It became more like a puzzle and I was the one with the pieces, and I just had to figure out how to put them together. Previously, it was more like I had the puzzle and I couldn't figure out a way to open to box. Haha Or something along those lines. About halfway through our project Dave was over helping "The Dream Team" with a problem. Shout out to the other half of the dream team, [Wenson](www.wensontsai.github.io). If you want to be inspired and laugh and gain some wisdom click that link. Anyway, Dave noted that "I always have the right intuition but I hesitate." I may have paraphrased that slightly, but the message is the same. So this weekend I'm going to try to build a mini app, let myself make some mistakes, and trust myself to figure them out. Or give it the good old college try. I'm really excited about continuing along this journey and becoming an even better developer.

Goals
1. Build a mini app on Rails this weekend
2. Blog at least once a week besides Fridays
3. Go on a walk or run during lunch or after class at least twice a week now that we have lockers at Fullstack (upgrades, y'all. upgrades)


In the spirit of our J.R.R. Tolkien Quote Fridays...
