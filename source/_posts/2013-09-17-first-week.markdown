# H1 First Days at Fullstack
The first days have already been full of learning and sometimes, new frustrations. I don't know if I ever realized how many things can go wrong with your computer--this morning we spent the better half of the day trying to reinstall ruby in order for me to write this blog post. Luckily, David and Nimit are master coders and I think we worked it all. I'm going to download some updated software and hopefully that will help avoid some problems in the future. This afternoon we start on Ruby, so get ready for an update on that!
