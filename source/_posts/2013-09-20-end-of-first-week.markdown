# The First Week Comes to a Close
The first week at Fullstack has definitely been a challenging one. As I've told a couple of friends lately, "I've never been so intellecutally humbled and challenged." One of the biggest take aways has just been learning how to switch the way I approcah problems and understanding. While I completed nearly all of the preterm coursework, there is nothing like getting your hands dirty and actually trying to build something. This week has really taught me how to take each problem and break it down into logical steps, and in that I've realized that sometimes the hardest part is just figuring out where to start.


I really enjoyed buidling the profile page on the first day. It was an unintimdating way to get started, and start learning how to play around with things. The hardest thing for me this week was probably the octomailer project. I think I really struggled with just figuring out what the next step was, and it just wasn't clicking. I understand how we were using symbols and hashes and arrays on the more theoretical level, but when it came to actually writing the code and moving through it step by step I really struggled.I reviewed the project with my finished code afterwards and that helped solidfy the thought process a little bit. Since I hadn't gotten to haiku yet, I started on that, and I've really enjoyed working on building that so far! I really like how I can see the logical next steps-- that project is clicking more for me than the octomailer.
I think moving forward my biggest challenge is just overcoming the doubt that creeps in when something doesn't click immediately. I know I'm capable of learning how to do this, but I often find myself doubting my ability to learn and execute.
