Oh hello, dear readers. Apologies for my lack of presence; it's been a bit of a whirlwind as Fullstack wraps up.


Our last "official" day was Friday. Wednesday is Demo Day, and then we are off into the big bad (ass) coding world to face the internet on our own. The world is our oyster.


It's crazy to think about the past twelve weeks and all that they've encompassed. I've learned so much, built so many new mental models, and my humor now encompasses cheesy coding jokes that only a small percentage of the population understands. I've spent hours in front of this screen, and this computer has worked hard for me. I've probably gotten more utility out of it in these three months than all of college. But it's my tool now, and so it goes... I love this old thing.


Even though Fullstack is over and our time here is coming to an end, it doesn't feel like an "end." If anything, it's a beginning. David always compared our time at Fullsatck to being in the starting corral for a marathon, we are at the very beginning of the race. I would say that's pretty in line with my current feelings on the situation. We all know that this special time is over, but there's more to learn. A lot more to explore. And in that spirit, I thought I'd write a little bit about what I'm hoping to explore over my "break."


I want to delve deeper into Backbone. I want to know it in and out, build another project in it, and use it to do some more complex tasks. I am developing more of an appreciation for the frontend, and I am very interested to see how those technologies continue to develop. I think that will help open up the gateway to learning some of the other emerging front end frameworks. But hey, one at a time.

During the last couple of weeks it's become more clear that my CSS skills could be improved, and that knowing a little bit more would improve my efficiency. Besides, it feels great to make something beautiful and crisp, and I feel like I've barely begun to explore that space in the way that I want to. I want to find a good resource to dive into with some best practices and then build a template for a personal website.


Databases, data-structures, optimization, oh my! Are you getting excited yet? We've been doing practice algorithm problems, talking about scaling, and other more traditional computer science topics. And while all of us are confident in what we've learned so far and our ability to continue learning, we are starting to get a glimpse of all that we do not know. Computer Science is a big field, people spend four years in college studying it for a degree (like my little brother--hey Josh!), and we've spent three months. Of course there are some missing pieces. As we all look to become better developers, we will need to start filling in these gaps. Luckily for us, many university systems have open sourced their curriculum and starting this process is easier than ever. And maybe I'll even hit up my little brother for tips.


And finally, the most important, is to keep building. I want to keep making projects. It's the best way to learn, and I think it's the best way for me to gain confidence in myself. And besides, it's fun. I don't know if I would be able to stay away from that sublime text even if I wanted to.
