### Blackjack, Ruby, Databases, and Cronuts
This week has flown by. Each day is so full and before I know it, it's the end of the week. It makes me realize how fast these 12 weeks are going to go and how I need to be taking advantage of every minute of them.

This week started off with the blackjack project. This project involved two main tasks--writing the code that would generate a blackjack game between a dealer and a player, and writing the tests that would ensure that the code was going to work the way you anticipated. Using test driven development in real life is as hard as it sounds. Not only do you have to try and write code that executes what you want, but you have to write a test that passes based on whether you write that code correctly. In reality, it takes a ton of time on the front end, but when you are done you know you have code that is functioning how it should (assuming you wrote good tests... but you know what happens when you assume). This exercise was really difficult at first, but as time went on it became more natural and your brain learns to switch between the two different objectives. I think I'll probably try and work through this project again this weekend, or at least review it again. It was really helpful in conceptualizing what was going on in your code and how to write effective tests.


We then switched gears to databases. I think some people found this topic lackluster and a necessary evil, but I found it really interesting! I love the idea of being able to extract very exact information. It gives you access to so many different things, and is so applicable in the real world. When learning SQL it was more a matter of getting syntax and little tricks down. I'm by no means an expert, but I think it's something I'll play around with more, especially as we start building web apps and potentially gathering data on users. I think as a student of international affairs and public administration I've always been shown the power of data, and I'm excited to have a better understanding of how to access and use it.


From SQL we transitioned over to a project of building our own Active Record(a rails feature), called Simple Record. Once I grasped what we were doing in this project I thought it was really cool! We basically built a way to access a databse(in our case SQL) using the Ruby language. There was a lot going on in this project, and once we were into it we had hundreds of lines of code. And of course, David showed us how we could condense that all down, deeming much of our code unnecessary. But hey! I struggled through it and I think it was worth it for the cognitive gains. I definitely gained a better understanding of what is going on in Active Record, and this weekend I plan on taking another look at what we built for the Simple Record project and making sure I'm understanding what's going on at each step.


I think this week has been a transitional week. Now that I am getting my bearings, I'm starting to see the dots connect, gaining more understanding, and getting excited about what's to come. But I'm probably still struggling to gain confidence in myself as a programmer. I second guess my self alot, defer to my partner's opinion, and occasionally make some self deprecating jokes (a very unbecoming habit that I'm trying to stop). I think this weekend I need to just get my head straight. As David mentinoed in our one-on-one last week "The computer won't judge you." I don't know if it's so much of a lack of confidence as much as it is self consicousness. I can feel it starting to drop away as more concepts click. All in all, I feel like I'm on the upswing. The basic concept coding hill doesn't seem quite as steep as it use to, and I'm starting to enjoy our projects more. This weekend and the beginning of next week will really be about grounding everything I've learned so far, and gearing up to take on even more difficult coding challenges. I can't wait to see what the next week holds!


P.S. I tried for cronuts today. No luck, the line was around the block. Next week I'm going to try again.
