I'm starting to lose track of the weeks. And sometimes the day. With daylight savings time, I've lost track of the hours on occassion too. I always think it's gloomy and gray outside because it's so dark, but then I go on the roof and look up, and it's blue skies for days. We just get caught in the shadows of all the tall office buildings. Ah, New York.


This week has been a "bring it all together" kinda week. We have been sharpening our JavaScript chops, modifying the DOM with jQuery, oh and we introduced Backbone.js. It's been a good week though. I've started to feel the pieces come together. I'm enjoying JavaScript (still confused about the colons though; working on it) and I enjoy writing code in it. And if you need someone to explain protypical inheritance, I got you. Definitely an improvement about how I was feeling about it from last week.  It's fun, and I'm figuring it out. I'm in a good place, friends. But man, am I tired. There is so much to learn and as I learn more there becomes even more opportunity to learn. It's a big computer world out there.


BackBone is still coming together. I'm still not tracking with everything it does. The concept is interesting, but I think learning the syntax and how it all links up  is going to take me more time. But I will. Of that, I am confident.


This Friday also marks our first round of mock interviews. There's "no pressure" but I definitely don't want to completely flop. I have learned, I have! Ha-- but it'll be good. Just another thing to focus on getting better at and continuing to grow and develop as a developer.


Oh my gosh. I haven't even talked about our speakers. So Monday we had the founder of Beeminder, Daniel Reeves. I love his business model and idea. I think it's genius. Go checkout Beeminder if you have a goal that you are having trouble achieving. Then on Tuesday we had Emily Stolfo from MongoDB. The fact that they store objects in JSON-like objects. And documents and collections... WOW. I was geeking out over a database. I have arrived. I want to try to use it for one of my projects before Fullstack. Thanks, Emily, for the inspiration!


And we will be finishing off with Stacksgiving tomorrow. Feeling very thankful that I'm doing something exciting and challenging at this point in my life. And I love some good pumpkin pie.
