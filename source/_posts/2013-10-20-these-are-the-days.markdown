Another weekend has (almost) come and gone, and in line with my goal to blog more, I decided a little afternoon post was in order.

Friday at Fullstack (post Friday blogging) was a change of pace for all of us. That may be an understatement actually. It was more like we have all been running a marathon and all the sudden we are in row boat in the middle of a lake. In preparation for us starting HTML and CSS we had an afternoon art lesson. Oh yes, you were are not mistaken. Art. Did I mentionwe are a bunch of budding techies? We stepped away from our computers for like 5 waking hours. Records, people. Records.

Nimit's wife was our lovely instructor. She walked us through some of the basics first. Basics such as lighting and shading, and even a little topography. Needless to say, most of us needed some extra help and guidance. Then we moved onto the big dawg--painting. At Fullstack we don't wait to dive in and go for it. Nope, go big or go home. Always. We first made a grid and sketched our picture in. Then we just went for it with the paint. It was relaxing and we put on some music and I think for the most part we all enjoyed it. Except Julian, who I was sitting alongside. He said that this art was "putting him a bad place." He makes up for his lack of artistic talent in other ways. Anyway, I enjoyed the change of venue and schedule. I'm also so tired on Friday afternoons, and this was a great way to stretch the mind and try something new without any pressure. Then several of us capped off the night with dinner in Chinatown--a first for me. Two words, y'all: soup dumplings.

When I came into Fullstack yesterday and looked at all of our "works of art" on the table, I blurted out "These are really bad." Alas, we don't have to paint by hand, and soon we will be making beautiful works of art with code. After spending some time at Fullstack yesterday reviewing Rails--all that prework makes a WHOLE lot more sense with some context--and watching the Dawgs lose (to Vandy of all schools--I can't even...), I headed over to the mobile payments hackathon. Some fellow Fullstackers had been there all day and were going to present their project at 6. They did a wonderful job, and I would say they presented one of the more articulate and organized presentations. They didn't place, but hey-- we've only been doing this for five weeks. So I say rock on. They were great. Then the night ended with some much needed college football. How about that FSU/Clemson game?

Sundays are for rest. Or at least that's what I've tried to make them. I feel like it's important to gear up for the week and start Mondays off strong. Today I worked out (briefly), read this morning and enjoyed a cup of joe, and took a nap. I then headed to Washington Square Park to enjoy this AMAZING fall weather. There's a man who rolls his piano there and plays for free everyday. Apparently he's some old concert pianoist who quit and decided he'd rather play in the park. I don't mind--only in New York. I brought a book and a warm jacket and enjoyed alternately reading and people watching. Now I'm back at home blogging. Resting and enjoying a quiet afternoon before church and one more social gathering before we all dive back into the business.


It's funny because not only am I learning to code, but I'm learning New York. It's a hard balance--because I want to get as much of each while I can. Because I'm not guaranteed time here I want to enjoy the city, but I also want to learn as much as I can and put in as much time as I can coding so that I'm prepared when this is all over. But New York has been kind to me so far aside from some choice incidents and the always present stench.  Luckily this fall weather is to die for and helps with the questionable aromas arising from trashbags and other miscelaneous sidewalk items. I wonder when puffer jacket weather will start. Home is where the heart is right? (I'm thinking of you Chickfila and Lucy Bear--my dog). It's exciting to be here. I never anticipated this is where I would be, but I'm loving it. And I feel like even better things are in store.


Sunday Funday means that you get two J.R.R. Tolkien quotes...


“There is nothing like looking, if you want to find something. You certainly usually find something, if you look, but it is not always quite the something you were after.”
― J.R.R. Tolkien, *The Hobbit*


“Yes, I am here. And you are lucky to be here too after all the absurd things you've done since you left home.”
― J.R.R. Tolkien, *The Fellowship of the Ring*
