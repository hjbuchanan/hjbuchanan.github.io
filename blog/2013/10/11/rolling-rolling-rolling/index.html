<div class="entry-content"><p>The fourth week is at a close, and with it we have completed a third of our time here at Fullstack. It is almost the middle of October and even though we still have plenty of time left (which I certainly need), I find myself sad that so much time here has already passed.</p>

<p>This week marked the beginning of the much anticipated start of Rails. For those who are unfamiliar with what I mean when I refer to &ldquo;Rails&rdquo;, it is a framework designed that makes web development much faster (once you get the hang of it). It sets up a framework for you to build a web application in, and frees you from much of the set up time and hassle. It is beloved by Ruby developers everywhere. And hopefully, with more time I will develop the same love and appreciation for the gift to all developers that is Rails. For a Rails newbie it can seem like magic sometimes&mdash; certain capabilities and structures are just &ldquo;magically&rdquo; there for you to use and you don&rsquo;t have to wwrite the code yourself. It&rsquo;s a dream. But then there&rsquo;s the task that comes alongside that of having to actually understand what&rsquo;s happening. I am struggling to grasp some of the intricacies of Rails, but I can see how it changed the game for developers. At this point, it&rsquo;s really a matter of connecting the dots, spending more and more time in the framework, and developing an intuitive sense of what Rails is doing under the hood.</p>

<p>On Tuesday this week we went to a Developers&#8217; Meet Up in the Financial District. It was our coming out debut as New York developers (haha, jokes). But it was a really interesting meeting and gave us another glimpse into the culture and community of New York Start Ups. We headed over to the StackOverflow office which was a conveneint five minute walk away from Fullstack. Their office was everything you think of when you think of a place you&rsquo;d want to work&mdash; great views, stocked kitchen and bar, lounge area, and an open modern floor plan. Some of us may have drooled a little. Anyway, about five start ups presented on the way they were using Ruby in their apps and in their businesses. The uses varied widely as did the products. There were topics that were definitely over our heads, but I think we all gained a lot from the experience. It exposed me to the variety of uses for Ruby and also the ways that businesses are integrating other languages and making use of the robust options and tools available through Ruby Gems. As a side note, Imon and I noticed there were about ten women developers there out of maybe a hundred. The numbers are rough, but you get the picture. This experience coupled with Twitter&rsquo;s recent IPO news (there was a great New York Times article on that), along with my viewing Sheryl Sandberg&rsquo;s Ted Talk from 2010 have spurred a lot of thought on women in tech and business in general. Stay tuned for a post on that.</p>

<p>As a closing thought, and perhaps the beginning of a new weekly tradition, and in light of the baby steps we take each day and week I&rsquo;d like to close with a quote from J.R. Tolkein &lsquo;Little by little, one travels far.&rsquo;</p>
