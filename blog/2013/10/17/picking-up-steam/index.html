<div class="entry-content"><h2>Rails on Rails</h2>

<p>This week we started to build our first big Rails project. To be honest, I was completely nervous and freaked out about starting a group project on Rails. I felt like we had barely been exposed to the framework by working in it on StackWorld. But as is usually the case, I think David and Nimit were right to throw us into a big group project this soon. I think I have a natural tendency to want to sort it all out before I actually do anything, and sometimes the most effective way to learn is to just do it&mdash;break some things (a lot of things), and then learn how to fix them.</p>

<p>My group was one of the groups with four members. In some ways, I think this gave us an advantage. Four minds working on a problem, three other people to ask questions when something goes wrong. But it also meant we had to be a little more organized and had to make sure that we were keeping track of everyone&rsquo;s work. Our group was really into the SCRUM model and using Trello. Actually, we loved <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>. We loved scrumming. We held scrum meetings two or three times a day (depending on the issues that arise and the work flow). I honestly don&rsquo;t know how other groups kept track of their project without it. Y&#8217;all are crazy. Trello really allowed us to see our progress and also helped us define our goals around our project more clearly. There wasn&rsquo;t wasted effort because we knew the tasks that had to be completed. I think I&rsquo;ll continue to use Trello for future group projects and even for projects that I&rsquo;m working on independently. I love the over view that it gives you, and the ability to see the longer term goals as well as the details. Kudos and thanks to the people of Trello.</p>

<p>Back to Rails. What&rsquo;s neat about Rails is basically everything. There are a ton of built in conventions and helper methods defined for you. It anticipates what you will want and need and it practically hands you a good bit of this on a platter. But things aren&rsquo;t all ruby and roses in Rails. Rails conventions are great. Until you break them. Accidentally. Or you name something with or without the desired &rsquo;s&#8217;. Note to all: grammar IS important. Typos will cause death by error messages. Don&rsquo;t be fooled, that comma matters. You may spend an hour deciphering an error message and trying all different types of syntax for a route and come to find out that you were missing a comma. Not that that&rsquo;s ever happened to me&hellip; But really, as you dig in more to the set up it all starts to make more sense. I&rsquo;m definitely not all there yet, but it&rsquo;s getting more natural. I trust my intuition more, and I&rsquo;m not as scared to break something. If I do, that&rsquo;s okay. I just won&rsquo;t push it up. Or I&rsquo;ll do a stash. Or I&rsquo;ll git reset &mdash;hard. I may have over utilized that tool in the beginning of our project haha. Git is a whole other story. But it is magic as well and I love it.</p>

<p>On a more personal level, this week has definitely been a tipping point. I think learning any new skill is a challenge and can bring about frustrations and doubts. And I think I let that get in my head for awhile. And the crazy thing was that I knew it was happening. I knew that I was letting self doubt and a lack of confidence affect my work and learning curve. I think this week I may have overcome that, or at least started that process. Coding became WAY more fun as I started to trust my instincts more, and started to solve some problems on my own. It became more like a puzzle and I was the one with the pieces, and I just had to figure out how to put them together. Previously, it was more like I had the puzzle and I couldn&rsquo;t figure out a way to open to box. Haha Or something along those lines. About halfway through our project Dave was over helping &ldquo;The Dream Team&rdquo; with a problem. Shout out to the other half of the dream team, <a href="www.wensontsai.github.io">Wenson</a>. If you want to be inspired and laugh and gain some wisdom click that link. Anyway, Dave noted that &ldquo;I always have the right intuition but I hesitate.&rdquo; I may have paraphrased that slightly, but the message is the same. So this weekend I&rsquo;m going to try to build a mini app, let myself make some mistakes, and trust myself to figure them out. Or give it the good ol college try. I&rsquo;m really excited about continuing along this journey and becoming an even better developer.</p>

<p>Goals
1. Build a mini app on Rails this weekend
2. Blog at least once a week besides Fridays
3. Go on a walk or run during lunch or after class at least twice a week now that we have lockers at Fullstack (upgrades, y&#8217;all. upgrades)</p>

<p>In the spirit of our J.R.R. Tolkien Quote Fridays&hellip;</p>
